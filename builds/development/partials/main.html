        <h4>
            YumDB is a new kind of recipe database. Rather than searching
            just by keywords like most common recipe databases, YumDB is
            capable of searching by ingredients you want to include and
            exclude in your food. So save the trip to the grocery store,
            get cooking with YumDB using the ingredients you already have!

            <h2>Waste less food</h2>
            <p>
                Always have trouble using food before it expires? Gather
                up all your food that's about to expire and find a recipe that
                incorporates most or all of those ingredients. You'll save time
                and money, and waste much less food!

                Search for recipes based on allergies, dietary restrictions,
                specific courses, types of cuisine, and even holidays. Pick the
                ingredients you want to use and even the ingredients you don't,
                and pick an awesome recipe to impress your friends and family
                based on your exact specifications!
